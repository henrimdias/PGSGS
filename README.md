# PGSGS
This repository contains the pipeline and scripts for the Pan-Grass Syntenic Gene Set (PGSGS), a dataset on orthologous/homeologous gene relationships across 17 grass species. PGSGS supports functional genomics in grasses, exploring genome evolution post-polyploidy. Data and scripts enhance cross-species functional research.
